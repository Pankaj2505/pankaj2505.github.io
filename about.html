 Working with clients had made me relaise Rather than just having problem solving mindset we should also think about below persepective 
 <br>
 1. what differece this new requirement is going to bring in the life of end user 
 <br>
 2. How important the project is for company .
 <br>
 3. what more simpler design and functionality we can add for more meaning ful projects
 <br>
 4. Rather than coding from scratch how can we use the existing code.
